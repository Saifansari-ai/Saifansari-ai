# ​ Hi, I'm Mohd. Saif Ansari  

Welcome to my GitHub! 🚀  
I'm a **Final Year BTech Student (India)** specializing in **Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Intelligent Agent Systems**.  
My current passion lies in developing **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) AI Agents** and pushing into the frontier of **Agentic AI**—creating systems that think, act, and learn autonomously.
